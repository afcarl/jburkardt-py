      HUMP <br> Print a Timestamp

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>HUMP</b> is a PYTHON routine which
      reads a file describing the parameters of an icesheet problem,
      generates the corresponding data, and writes that data to a
      NETCDF file for input to a solver.
    </p>

    <p>
      The particular problem generated by the "config" file presented
      here is a simplistic, artificial test case of a sinusoidal
      "hump" of ice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that <b>HUMP</b> requires the <b>numpy</b> module, which is
      available from <a href = "http://numpy.scipy.org">
                                http://numpy.scipy.org </a>.
