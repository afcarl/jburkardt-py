SUPPRESS_SPACES
  Demonstrate Python's output spacing convention,
  and how to suppress it.

  Suppose we want to print a string of binary digits,
  each stored in a separate entry of a vector.
  A print statement inside a loop might do it.

1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 

  But suppose we want the digits right next to each other?
  We are annoyed now, that Python's print command, 
  trying to be helpful, automatically inserts spaces.
  Try sys.stdout.write(str(VARIABLE)) instead.
