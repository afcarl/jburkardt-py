      TIMESTAMP <br> Print a Timestamp
    </h1>

    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b> is a PYTHON script which
      prints the current YMDHMS date (year-month-day-hours-minutes-seconds)
      as a timestamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is useful when documenting the run of a program.  By
      including a timestamp, the output of the program will always
      contain a clear indication of when it was created.  Other
      indicators, such as the file modification timestamp, may be
      misleading or subject to unintentional modification.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b> simply gives the current time.  If you are
      trying to do careful timings of the speed of execution of
      a computer code, this may not be very accurate, especially
      on a computer that uses timesharing.
